# Bioacoustics datasets


## Introduction
This repository gathers the list of online publicly available bioacoustics datasets that can be used together with deep learning. You can visualise this table at the following url: https://bioacoustic-ai.github.io/bioacoustics-datasets/. This list aims at providing an overview of what data is currently accessible to train and evaluate models. Note that this work is **in progress**, and missing information will be progressively added. We aim at keeping this list up-to-date, and you can contribute by opening a pull request to add new datasets. The procedure to add a new dataset is explained in the next section.

## Want to contribute?
That's great! You can contribute in two ways. The first way to contribute is to add more information on the already listed datasets, or add another dataset. In order to modify the existing datasets, you only need to modify its json file, located in the directory `datasets_json`. To add a new dataset, download the file called `dataset_template.json`. Then, open it and fill as many fields as possible. Finally, place it in the folder `datasets_json` and open a pull request. We recommend to fill at least the fields `authors`, `description`, `url`, `version`, and `license`. You will find a description of each of the fields below. You can also open a github issue to refer us to a new dataset if you do not wish to fill the information yourself.

The second way to contribute is to make the webapp better, either by proposing improvements in github issues, or by implementing them directly. Read the README file in the `frontend` folder to run the webapp locally.

## Description of the fields

You can find an explanation of each field in alphabetical order below. You can also look at other `json` files in the `datasets_json` folder for more examples.
