Passive Acoustic Monitoring and Transfer Learning. BioRxiv doi:\n\nThis dataset contains approximately 10 hours of audio that contained calls of\nthe vulnerable Thyolo Alethe (Chamaetylas choloensis). The audio data was\ncollected in the Mount Mulanje Biosphere Reserve, Malawi using 10 Audiomoths.\nThe sampling rate was set to 32,000Hz and the recordings were obtained over\nfive days in November 2020. A larger dataset exists.\n\nThe annotations files are in (.svl) format which is compatible with\nSonicVisualiser (https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/). Each audio file has a\ncorresponding .svl file. Each .svl has segments of audio that were manually\nannotated as either ''thyolo-alethe\" (presence class) or \"noise\" (absence\nclass) -- this dataset can be used to train a binary classification model.\n\nThe audio files are provided in \"Audio.zip\" and the manually verified\nannotation in \"Annotations.zip\".\n\n",
