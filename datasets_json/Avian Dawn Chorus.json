  "description": "**General Summary**\n\nThis acoustic data collection includes 1,575 5-minute soundscape recordings\nrandomly selected from passive acoustic recordings made at 525 sites during\n2022 on federally managed lands in western California, Oregon, and Washington,\nUSA. We fully labeled 141 recordings (11.75 hrs) with 39,717 annotations for\n118 sound types, including 58 avian species, two mammalian species, six\naggregated biotic sounds, and eight non-biotic sound types. An additional 215\nrecordings were partially annotated with 1,466 annotations. The remaining\nunlabeled recordings have been included to facilitate novel research\napplications and methodological evaluations. Beyond the labeled soundscape\nrecordings, we have included township and range identifications and 38\nenvironmental covariates for each recording location.\n\n**Data Collection**\n\nLesmeister et al. (2021) collected passive acoustic recordings during 2022 in\nsupport of long-term monitoring of federally threatened northern spotted owl\n(_Strix occidentalis caurina)_ populations under the Northwest Forest Plan\nEffective Monitoring Program (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990, U. S.\nDepartment of Agriculture and U. S. Department of the Interior 1994). These\ndata were collected at 643 hexagons that were randomly selected from a\ntessellation of 5 km2 hexagons covering the entire range of the northern\nspotted owl (Northern California, Oregon, Washington) under a selective\nconstraint that hexagons contain \u2265 50 % forest-capable lands (_def._ forested\nlands or lands capable of developing closed-canopy forests) and be \u2265 25%\nfederal ownership (Davis et al., 2011).\n\nEach hexagon was sampled by four Song Meter 4 (SM4) acoustic recording units\n(Wildlife Acoustics, Maynard, MA) deployed in a standardized spatial\narrangement, such that recorders on a site were placed \u2265 500 m apart and were\n\u2265 200 m from the edge of the sampling hexagon boundary. Recorders were mounted\nto small trees (15 - 20 cm diameter at breast height) approximately 1.5 m\nabove the ground and were placed on mid-to-upper slopes and \u2265 50 m from roads,\ntrails, and streams. The SM4 devices each have two built-in omnidirectional\nmicrophones with a signal-to-noise ratio of 80 dB, typical at 1 kHz, and a\nrecording bandwidth of 20 Hz - 48 kHz. Each device recorded ~11 hours of audio\ndaily for six weeks from March to August at a sampling rate of 32 kHz. The\ndaily recording schedule included a 4-hour window from two hours before\nsunrise to two hours after sunrise, a 4-hour window from one hour before\nsunset to 3 hours after sunset, and 10-minute recordings outside the two\nlonger recording blocks at the start of every hour.\n\n**Data Sampling**\n\nThe goal of this project was to develop a tagged audio dataset (hereafter\nproject dataset) focused on the avian dawn chorus, which is an ecologically\nimportant period for the study of avian behavior (McNamara et al. 1987,\nStaicer et al. 1996, Zhang et al. 2015) and monitoring avian biodiversity\n(Bibby et al. 2000), but remains a challenging problem for acoustic\nclassification systems (Duan et al. 2013, Stowell 2022). Passive acoustic\nmonitoring on our sites occurs throughout the day. We filtered the full\ndataset to recordings collected between May and August during the hour\nimmediately after sunrise. From the recordings meeting our filtering criteria,\nwe randomly selected three 5-minute files from each site, which were assigned\nordinal labels 'A, 'B,' or 'C.' The final project dataset comprised 131.25\nhours of acoustic data.\n\n**Annotation Protocol**\n\nWe randomly selected 141 sites from the project dataset and fully annotated\neach recording at a 2-second resolution. We applied labels to each 2-second\nwindow of the selected recordings following a predefined sound phonology\nlibrary (available in the 'metadata.csv' file), which concatenated the 2021\neBird taxonomy codes (Clements list; Clements et al. 2022) with standardized\nsonotype codes that incremented depending on the species repertoire (i.e.,\n'call_1,' 'song_1,' 'drum_1'). For example, 'herthr_song_1' is the label for\nHermit Thrush, song_1. Unknown signals were labeled 'unknown,' and clips with\nno biotic signals (or noise classes of interest documented in metadata.csv)\nwere labeled 'empty.' Windows were labeled 'complete' and considered fully\nannotated when every signal was assigned an annotation. Files were deemed\nfully annotated when every 2-second window contained the 'complete' label.\n\n**Environmental Covariates**\n\nSampling locations will not be published to afford protections for Federally\nThreatened or Endangered species which may occur on our sites. However, we\nprovide the State, Township, and Range for each sampling location along with\nthe site-specific values for 38 forest structure, topographic, and climatic\nenvironmental covariates developed by the Landscape Ecology, Modeling,\nMapping, and Analysis group in the Pacific Northwest\n(<https://lemma.forestry.oregonstate.edu/data>; Ohmann and Gregory 2002).\nState, Township, and Range values are sufficient to explore geographic\nvariation in species- or community-specific call and song phenology and the\nextracted environmental covariates may provide useful contextual information\nfor novel machine-learning developments (Liu et al. 2018).\n\n**Description of Data Format**\n\nThe fully annotated audio files can be accessed by downloading and extracting\n\"annotated_recordings.zip.\" Partially annotated and non-annotated audio files\ncan be accessed by downloading and extracting\n\"additional_recordings_part_1.zip\" or \"additional_recordings_part_2.zip.\"\nAcoustic file names contain site and replicate indicators, such that file\n\"Site_001_Rep_A.wav' was recorded on site 1 and is the A replicate random draw\nfrom the available set of dawn chorus recordings. The site and replicate\nnumbers link to additional recording information in \"files.csv,\" annotations\nin \"annotations.csv\" and \"partial_annotations.csv,\" as well as site and\nreplicate specific environmental characteristics in\n\"environmental_characteristics.csv.\"\n\nMetadata describing sound classes and environmental characteristics can be\nfound in \"metadata.csv,\" and \"environmental_characteristics_metadata.csv.\"\n\n**Acknowledgments**\n\nAcoustic data collection was funded and collected by the US Forest Service and\nthe US Bureau of Land Management. Annotation work was funded by Google. We\nwould also like to thank the many biologists that collected and processed the\ndata compiled here.
