  "description": "BirdVox-ANAFCC: A dataset for American Northeast Avian Flight Call\nClassification  \n===============================================================  \nVersion 2.0, February 2022.\n\nhttps://wp.nyu.edu/birdvox\n\n  \nDescription  \n\\---------------\n\nBirdVox-ANAFCC is a dataset of short audio waveforms, each of them containing\na flight call from one of 14 birds of North America: four American sparrows,\none cardinal, two thrushes, and seven New World warblers.  \n* American Tree Sparrow (ATSP)  \n* Chipping Sparrow (CHSP)  \n* Savannah Sparrow (SAVS)  \n* White-throated Sparrow (WTSP)  \n* Red-breasted Grosbeak (RBGR)  \n* Gray-cheeked Thrush (GCTH)  \n* Swainson's Thrush (SWTH)  \n* American Redstart (AMRE)  \n* Bay-breasted Warbler (BBWA)  \n* Black-throated Blue Warbler (BTBW)  \n* Canada Warbler (CAWA)  \n* Common Yellowthroat (COYE)  \n* Mourning Warbler (MOWA)  \n* Ovenbird (OVEN)\n\nIt also contains other sounds which are often confused for one of the species\nabove. These \"confounding factors\" encompass flight calls from other species\nof birds, vocalizations from non-avian animals, as well as some machine beeps.\n\nBirdVox-ANAFCC results from an aggregation of various smaller datasets,\nintegrated under a common taxonomy. For more details on this taxonomy, we\nrefer the reader to [1]:\n\n[1] Cramer, Lostanlen, Salamon, Farnsworth, Bello. Chirping up the right tree:\nIncorporating biological taxonomies into deep bioacoustic classifiers.\nProceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and\nSignal Processing (ICASSP), 2020.\n\nThe second version of the BirdVox-ANAFCC dataset (v2.0) contains flight calls\nfrom the BirdVox-full-night dataset. These flight calls were present in the\nICASSP 2020 benchmark but did not appear in the initial release of BirdVox-\nANAFCC.\n\n  \nData Files  \n\\------------  \nBirdVox-ANAFCC contains the recordings as HDF5 files, sampled at 22,050 Hz,\nwith a single channel (mono). Each HDF5 file contains flight call\nvocalizations of a particular species. The name of each HDF5 file follows the\nformat: `<data-source>_<taxonomy-code>_original.h5`. The name of the HDF5\ndataset in each file is \"waveforms\", with the corresponding key for each audio\nrecording varying in format depending on the data source.\n\n\n\nMetadata Files  \n\\---------------  \n`taxonomy.yaml` details the three-level taxonomy structure used in this\ndataset, reflected in three-number-codes which largely follow\n\"<family>.<order>.<species>\". Additionally, at any level of the taxonomy, the\nnumeric code \"0\" is reserved for \"other\" and the code \"X\" refers to unknown.\nFor example, 1.1.0 corresponds to an American Sparrow with a species outside\nof our scope of interest, and 1.1.X corresponds to an American Sparrow of\nunknown species. At the top level (family), the \"other\" codes (0.\\\\*.\\\\*)\ndeviate from the family-order-species in order to capture a variety of other\nout-of-scope sounds, including anthropophony, non-avian biophony, and biophony\nof avians outside of the scope of interest.\n\n  \nPlease acknowledge BirdVox-ANAFCC in academic research  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen BirdVox-ANAFCC is used for academic research, we would highly appreciate\nit if  scientific publications of works partly based on this dataset cite the\nfollowing publication:\n\nCramer, Lostanlen, Salamon, Farnsworth, Bello.
