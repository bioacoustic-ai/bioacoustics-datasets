  "description": "This is a test data for the program \"Birdsong Recognition\"\n(<https://github.com/takuya-koumura/birdsong-recognition>) and the manuscript\n\"Automatic recognition of element classes and boundaries in the birdsong with\nvariable sequences\" by Takuya Koumura and Kazuo Okanoya\n([http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159188](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06248)).\n\n  \n\nThe source code of the program is available at <https://github.com/takuya-\nkoumura/birdsong-recognition>.  \n  \nThe data includes songs in Bengalese finches, manual annotations of the song\nelements, and expected validation errors.  \n  \nSongs were collected from eleven birds (from Bird0 to Bird10). Data is located\nin the directory \u201cWave E The sound format is 16-bit linear PCM with sampling\nrate of 32 kHz.  \n  \nAnnotations are defined in XML format. Annotation of each sequence includes\nthe name of wave file, position and length of the sequence in the wave file,\nand annotations of sound elements in the sequence. Annotation of each sound\nelement includes position and length in the sequence and the label of the\nelement. The schema for the XML file is in birdsong-\nrecognition/xsd/AnnotationSchema.xsd or at\n<http://marler.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/files/koumura-\nokanoya-2016-songs/xsd/AnnotationSchema.xsd>  \n  \nValidation errors are the expected values that would be obtained by running\nthe program in <https://github.com/takuya-koumura/birdsong-recognition> with\nhyper parameters provided in the source code. The program contains three\nalgorithms for automatic recognition: \"BD -> LC -> GS\", \"LC -> BD & GS\" and\n\"LC & GS -> BD & GS\" Expected errors for each algorithm are provided in\n\"ErrorBdLcGs.xml\", \"ErrorLcBdGs.xml\", \"ErrorLcGsBdGs.xml\". Each file contains\ntwo types of validation errors: \"Levenshtein error\" and \"matching error\".\nPlease read the manuscript for the description of the algorithms and errors.\nThe schema for the XML file is in birdsong-recognition/xsd/ErrorSchema.xsd or\nat <http://marler.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/files/koumura-\nokanoya-2016-songs/xsd/ErrorSchema.xsd>  \n\n  \n\n",
