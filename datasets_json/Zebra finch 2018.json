  "description": "**Vocalization library of the Zebra finch**\n\n  \n\nThis vocalization library was collected between 2011 and 2014 at the\nUniversity of California Berkeley by Julie E Elie using birds bred in the\ncolony of the Theunissen Lab.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n__Citations__\n\nPlease cite the following papers when using data from this collection:\n\n  \n\n-> Elie JE and Theunissen FE.

The sounds are organized in two zip folders according\nto the age of the vocalizer. The sex of adults is known. Each vocalization or\nsequence of vocalizations is saved as a wav file which name indicate the name\nof the individual (ColColxxxx), the type of vocalization (VT) and the\nrecording date (yymmdd) using the following scheme:\n\nColColxxxx_yymmdd-VT-zz.wav\n\nExample: GraLbl0457_110411-TetC-12.wav\n\n  \n\nColColxxxx : The name of the individual is always a string of 10 letters and\ndigits, e.g.: GraLbl0457\n\nyymmdd : The recording date always follows the first underscore as 6 digits,\ne.g.: 110411\n\nVT: The type of vocalization VT always follows the first hyphen and can be of\nvarious length but the first 2 letters always code the type of vocalization as\ndescribed in Animal Cognition 2016 along 11 categories:\n\n  \n\nAg -> Wsst or aggressive call\n\nBe -> Begging calls\n\nDC -> Distance call\n\nDi -> Distress call\n\nLT -> Long Tonal call\n\nNe -> Nest call\n\nSo -> Song\n\nTe -> Tet call\n\nTh -> Thuk call\n\nTu -> Tuck call\n\nWh -> Whine call\n\n  \n\nzz: the rendition number always follows the last hyphen.\n\n  \n\nNote that some discrepancies in the naming of files are known to exist and\nsomewhat expected since all of these 3433 files were manually annotated.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n__Contact__\n\nJulie E Elie: julie.elie@gmail.com\n\nFrederic E Theunissen : theunissen@berkeley.edu\n\n  \n\n",
