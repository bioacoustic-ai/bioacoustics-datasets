  "description": "**General Description:**\n\nThis is a development set used in the experiments in the Ph.D. thesis: \"Nowe\nmetody akustycznej identyfikacji ptakow migruj\u0105cych noc\u0105\" (_\" Novel methods of\nacoustic identification of birds migrating at night\"_) by Hanna Pamula. The\nproject focuses on the detection (and - partially - classification) of\npasserine birds' calls from long-term audio recordings collected during bird\nautumn migration between 2016 and 2019. The dataset consists of >56,5 hours of\nrecordings with annotations of nocturnal flight calls of passerine birds\nmigrating along the Baltic Sea coast, Poland.\n\n\n\n**Folder Structure**\n\nDevelopment_Set_3.1.zip\n\n|_Development_Set_3.1/\n\n    |__Training_Set/\n\n            |____*.wav\n\n            |____*.txt\n\n    |__Validation_Set/\n\n            |____*.wav\n\n            |____*.txt\n\n    |__Testing_Set/\n\n            |____*.wav\n\n            |____*.txt\n\nTraining Set: 86 recordings\n\nValidation Set: 8 recordings\n\nTesting set: 18 recordings (BUT: uploaded 20 recordings, as in the previous\nversion of the dataset - version 3, two additional recordings were used. Then,\nthey were deleted in the final version of development set 3.1. Two additional\nrecordings are: 'BUK5_20161101_002104a and BUK5_20161101_002104b)\n\nNames of waveforms and annotations are matching.\n\n**Waveforms:**\n\nThe whole dataset consists of 114 recordings. One hundred thirteen recordings\nare about 30 minutes long (29min56s - 29min 59s), one recording is 1min20s.\nAll data were recorded at 44,100 Hz sampling rate, one channel, with SM2\nWildlife Acoustics recorders + SMX-NFC microphone. The recording sessions were\nperformed at night (starting time and date denoted in a file name) on the\nBaltic Sea coast in Poland (D\u0105bkowice, near Dar\u0142owo).\n\n**Annotations:**\n\nTranscriptions were produced using Audacity 2.4.1:\nhttps://www.audacityteam.org/ by an experienced birdwatcher, Hanna Pamula.\nWhile every effort has been made to ensure the quality and accuracy of the\nlabels, some errors may occur, taking into account the difficulty of nocturnal\ncall recognition and transcription tasks in general.\n\nTranscription format:\n\n[Starting time (sec)] [Ending time (sec)] [Label]\n\n**Meaning of the labels:**\n\n1\\. Positive classes - migrating passerine birds:\n\n  * 's' - song thrush call (Turdus philomelos)\n  * 'k' - blackbird call (Turdus merula)\n  * 'd' - redwing call (Turdus iliacus)\n  * 'r' - robin call (Erithacus rubecula)\n  * 'kwiczol' - fieldfare call (Turdus pilaris)\n  * 'skowronek' - skylark call (Alauda arvensis)\n  * Each of the above labels could also have a question mark '?', e.g. 'r?', 'k?' - meaning that it's not a sure label. In a bird call detection task, they are regarded as positive chunks containing bird call(s).\n  * 'ni' - non identified bird call (distant/quiet/not recognized)\n\nOnly the supposed calls of migrating passerine birds were labeled; other\nsounds of species were ignored (e.g., robin's tik-calling, which can be often\nheard at dusk, and may be regarded as warning sounds).\n\n2\\. Negative classes - other marked sound events:\n\n  * 'g' - other bird calls/songs/sounds. Sounds that could confuse the model; for example, sounds of migrating geese, cranes, plovers calls, etc.\n  * 'gh' - human voices\n  * 't' - cracks, clicks, raindrops, other noise\n  * 'puszczyk' - tawny owl voice (Strix aluco)\n  * 'czapla' - grey heron voice (Ardea cinerea)\n\nNot all occurrences of the negative sounds were labeled - only some chosen\nexamples to represent the possible noises/negative samples. Thus these\nannotations can't be used for entirely different detection / classification\ntasks than intended, e.g., detecting migrating cranes or human voices in long-\nterm recordings.\n\n3\\. Labels to be excluded from analysis:\n\n  * '???', '??? mysz', '??? high freq' - unknown, not sure if the sound event is a birds' call or not. Uncertainty about belonging to a positive/negative class in the detection task.\n\n",
