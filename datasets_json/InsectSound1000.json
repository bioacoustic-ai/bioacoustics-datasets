  "description": "InsectSound1000 is a dataset comprising more than 169000 labelled sound samples of 12 insects species. The insect sound level spans from very loud (Bombus terrestris) to inaudible to human ears (Aphidoletes aphidimyza). The samples were extracted from more than 1000 h of recordings made in an anechoic box with a four-channel low-noise measurement microphone array. Each sample is a four-channel wave-file with a duration of 2500 ms, at 16 kHz sample rate and 32 bit resolution.",
