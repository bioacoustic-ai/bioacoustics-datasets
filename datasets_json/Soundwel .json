It\ncontains a total of 6888 calls produced by several hundred domestic pigs in 17\ndifferent context categories associated with negative or positive emotional\nvalence. See Briefer et al. 2022 for details about the contexts and attributed\nemotional valence. The settings used to generate the spectrograms from the\naudio files are also included in the above publication.\n\nPlease note that the slaughterhouse recordings used in Briefer et al. 2022\ncould not be included in the repository due to usage restrictions.\n\n",
