However, some files were judged to have a slightly different set\nof species present than was given in the original metadata.\n\n  \n\nExtra Unknown label was added to the dataset for the vocalisations that\ncouldn't be classified to a specific species. Also, extra Human label was\nadded for a few recordings that had human sounds present in them.\n\n  \n\nTranscription format:\n\n[Starting time (sec)],[Duration of event (sec)],[Label]\n\n",
