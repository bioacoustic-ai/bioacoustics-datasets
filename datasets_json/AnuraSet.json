  "description": "**raw_data.zip**\n\nRaw audio data collected in the field. It is composed of sub-folders that\nrepresent each monitoring site. Each sub-folder is composed of audio .wav\nfiles that follow the name of {site}_{date}_{time}.wav.\n\n**weak_labels.csv**\n\nAnnotation at a 1-minute level where each raw audio data it is assigned a\nvalue representing the anuran calling activity: 0 is absence; 1 is Low; 2 is\nModerate; and 3 is High. The CSV file is composed of two columns representing\nthe site and the file name and species columns with the anuran calling\nactivity.\n\n**strong_labels.zip**\n\nAnnotation at a high level with temporal limits (beginning and end) of audio\nsegments containing species-specific calls with an inter-call interval of less\nthan 1 second. As in raw_data, each sub-folder represents a monitoring site\nand the files are .txt containing (i) call beginning; (ii) call end; and (iii)\nthe species name and audio quality.\n\n**anuraset.zip**\n\nPreprocessed dataset with 93378 3-second audio samples input for benchmarking.\nThe dataset folder contains 2 files and one folder containing separate folders\nper site. The samples are WAV audio files with fixed 3-second lengths,\nobtained with 22.05 kHz sampling frequency and 16-bit depth. The two other\nfiles are a README file describing the structure and construction of the\ndataset and a metadata CSV file containing the labels for each sample.\n\n",
