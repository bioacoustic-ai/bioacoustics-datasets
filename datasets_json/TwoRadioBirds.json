  "description": "A multi-modal dataset containing recordings of an adult male and female Zebra\nFinch bird using a microphone and two accelerometer sensors. The dataset\nconsists of eleven data files of 1 hr. duration each, out of which three are\ndensely annotated, and eight are unlabelled. Each file contains data from a\nmicrophone (audio) and two accelerometers (body vibration) channels. The data\nin all channels are sampled at a rate of 24000 Hz.\n\nLink to paper (IEEE Xplore):\n<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10094650>\n\nLink to paper (arxiV): <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09376.pdf>\n\nLink to dataset: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7253729>\n\n**Cite as:**  Kumar, S., Anshuman, B., Ruttimann, L., Hahnloser, R.H. and\nArora, V., 2023, June.
