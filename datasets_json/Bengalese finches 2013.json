  "description": "The songs of Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata var. domestica) have complex\nsyntax and provide an opportunity to investigate how complex sequential\nbehavior emerges via the evolutionary process. In the present study, we\nsuggest that a simple mechanism, i.e., many-to-one mapping from internal\nstates onto syllables, may underlie the emergence of apparent complex syllable\nsequences that have higher-order history dependencies. We analyzed the songs\nof Bengalese finches and of their wild ancestor, the white-rumped munia\n(Lonchura striata), whose songs are more stereotypical and simpler compared to\nthose of Bengalese finches. The many-to-one mapping mechanism sufficiently\naccounted for the differences in the complexity of song syllable sequences of\nthese two strains.\n\n",
