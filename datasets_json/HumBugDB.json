  "description": "**A large-scale multi-species dataset of acoustic recordings**\n\nDataset accompanying code and paper: _HumBugDB: a large-scale acoustic\nmosquito dataset_.\n\nA large-scale multi-species dataset containing recordings of mosquitoes\ncollected from multiple locations globally, as well as via different\ncollection methods. In total, we present 71,286 seconds (20 hours) of labelled\nmosquito data with 53,227 seconds (15 hours) of corresponding background\nnoise, recorded at the sites of 8 experiments.  Of these, 64,843 seconds\ncontain species metadata, consisting of 36 species (or species complexes).\n\nThis repository contains:\n\n  * Multi-part zip of audio files to be extracted into the same folder\n  * Metadata in csv format: [neurips_2021_zenodo_0_0_1.csv](https://zenodo.org/api/files/5812d858-9cb8-45cf-af03-9f96f44a8313/neurips_2021_zenodo_0_0_1.csv?versionId=a062556f-30da-4c2a-a414-b24bdb67cbf9)\n\nThis data is supplemented by a GitHub repository, <https://github.com/HumBug-\nMosquito/HumBugDB>, which aids as follows:\n\n  * The multi-part zip is intended to be extracted into the folder:_/data/audio/_ in the repository.\n  * Latest metadata is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/HumBug-Mosquito/HumBugDB/tree/master/data/metadata) to allow the modification of additional metadata as it becomes available in the database or bug-fixing.\n  * Documentation for code use, and a complete Datasheet for Datasets also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/HumBug-Mosquito/HumBugDB/blob/master/docs/NeurIPS_2021_HumBugDB_Supplement.pdf).\n  * Example code for data splitting, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation in the top-level notebook _main.ipynb_.\n  * Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network models, in both Keras and PyTorch, trained on this data available at [GitHub release v1.0](https://github.com/HumBug-Mosquito/HumBugDB/releases/tag/v1.0)\n\n\n\n",
