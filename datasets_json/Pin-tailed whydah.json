  "description": "Data accompanying the paper: \"Passive Acoustic Monitoring and Transfer\nLearning\"\n\n**Please cite this dataset as:**\n\n> Dufourq, Emmanuel and Batist, Carly and Foquet, Ruben and Durbach, Ian.\n> (2022). Passive Acoustic Monitoring and Transfer Learning. BioRxiv doi:\n\nThis dataset contains approximately 6 hours of audio that contained calls of\nthe pin-tailed whydah (Vidua macroura). The audio data was collected in the\nIntaka Island Nature Reserve in Cape Town, South Africa using 1 Audiomoth. The\nsampling rate was set to 48,000Hz and the recordings were obtained over four\ndays in January 2021\\. A larger dataset exists.\n\nThe annotations files are in (.svl) format which is compatible with\nSonicVisualiser (https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/). Each audio file has a\ncorresponding .svl file. Each .svl has segments of audio that were manually\nannotated as either ''thyolo-alethe\" (presence class) or \"noise\" (absence\nclass) -- this dataset can be used to train a binary classification model.\n\nThe audio files are provided in \"Audio.zip\" and the manually verified\nannotation in \"Annotations.zip\".\n\n",
