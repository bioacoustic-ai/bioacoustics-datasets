  "description": "Data accompanying the paper: \"Automated detection of Hainan gibbon calls for\npassive acoustic monitoring\"\n\n**Please cite this dataset as:**\n\n> Dufourq, Emmanuel and Durbach, Ian and Hansford, James and Hoepfner, Amanda\n> and Ma, Heidi and Bryant, Jessica and Stender, Christina and Li, Wenyong and\n> Liu, Zhiwei and Chen, Qing and Zhou, Zhaoli and Turvey, Samuel. (2020).\n> Automated detection of Hainan gibbon calls for passive acoustic monitoring.\n> BioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.07.285502\n\nThe Hainan gibbon is the world's rarest primate and one of the world's rarest\nmammals, with only a single population of about 30 individuals surviving in\nBawangling National Nature Reserve (BNNR), Hainan, China. Eight Song Meter SM3\nrecorders (Wildlife Acoustics, Maynard, Massachusetts) were used to collect\nacoustic data from 1 March to 20 August 2016 within BNNR. Recorders were\nattached to trees at approximately 1.5 meters from the ground in tropical\nevergreen forest. Recorders were set to record for eight hours each day from\nthe time of sunrise, which varied between approximately 05:00 and 06:00 during\nthe study period. Devices did not record continuously throughout the entire\nsurvey period due to logistical and technical issues; in total, survey days\nper recorder varied between 79 and 129 days, and roughly 6,000 hours of\nrecordings were collected. The majority of recordings were made with a\nsampling rate of 9,600Hz and bit depth of 16, with isolated recordings at\n28,800Hz.\n\nWe provide the audio data (.wav) used to train and test our neural network\nclassifier along with the corresponding labelled text files (.data).\n\n**Files provided**\n\nTrain.zip - contains the training .wav audio files\n\nTrain_Labels.zip - contains the labels for the training data\n\nTest.zip - contains the testing .wav audio files\n\nTest_Labels.zip - contains the labels for the test data\n\nExtra_Labelled_Data.zip - contains extra data that was labelled and non-gibbon\ncalls used for training\n\nExtra_Labels.zip - contains the labels for the extra labelled data\n\nUnlabelled_Data.zip - contains additional .wav audio files which have not been\nlabelled. These are split into various files (1-15) and can be downloaded\nindividually.\n\nCode.zip - contains all the software scripts and notebooks\n\nManual-zip - contains the user manual\n\n**Labels**\n\nThe names of the labelled files start with either \"g_\" or \"n_\", for example\n\"g_HGSM3D_0+1_20160429_051600.data\" and \"n_HGSM3D_0+1_20160429_051600.data\".\nFiles starting with \"g_\" contain the timestamps of the gibbon calls, and files\nstarting with \"n_\" contain the timestamps of non-gibbon calls (e.g. background\nnoise and bird calls). An audio file will have both a \"g_\" and \"n_\" file. Each\nfile has the following format: Start,End,Duration,Type,Notes, where \"start\"\ndenotes the start time in seconds, \"end\" denotes the end time in seconds,\n\"duration\" denotes the duration (end - start) in seconds, \"type\" denotes the\ntype of call/noise and \"notes\" are additional notes which we labelled.\n\n**Types**\n\nThe legend for the \"type\" column in the labelled files is defined as follows.\nThe types for gibbon and non-gibbon files are different and we distinguish\nthis below.\n\n\n\nGibbon files (\"g_\")\n\ntype 1 = one pulse gibbon call\n\ntype 2 = multiple pulse gibbon call (check \"notes column\" below)\n\ntype 3 = duet gibbon call\n\n\n\n_Notes column (only available in gibbon files)_\n\nOne of the following: 2 pulse call, 3 pulse call, 4 pulse call, 5 pulse call\nor 6 pulse call.\n\n\n\nNon-gibbon files (\"n_\")\n\ntype 1 = rain\n\ntype 2 = other species (e.g. birds)\n\ntype 3 = rain and other species\n\ntype 4 = rain and external noise (e.g. aircraft)\n\ntype 5 = natural sounds and external noise\n\ntype 6 = natural sounds and other species\n\n**Training files (containing gibbon calls):**\n\nHGSM3AC_0+1_20160309_055600  \nHGSM3AC_0+1_20160312_055400  \nHGSM3A_0+1_20160304_060000  \nHGSM3BD_0+1_20160305_060000  \nHGSM3AC_0+1_20160314_055200  \nHGSM3B_0+1_20150616_050500  \nHGSM3BD_0+1_20160402_053600  \nHGSM3D_0+1_20160429_051600  \nHGSM3B_0+1_20160305_060000  \nHGSM3C_0+1_20160501_051500  \nHGSM3SOL_0+1_20160320_054700  \nHGSM3SOL_0+1_20160405_053400  \nHGSM3BD_0+1_20160401_053700\n\n**Testing files:**\n\nHGSM3B_0+1_20160323_054500  \nHGSM3B_0+1_20160321_054700  \nHGSM3B_0+1_20160306_055900  \nHGSM3B_0+1_20160308_055700  \nHGSM3B_0+1_20160309_055600  \nHGSM3B_0+1_20160316_055100  \nHGSM3B_0+1_20160311_055500  \nHGSM3B_0+1_20160304_060000  \nHGSM3B_0+1_20160322_054600\n\n",
