  "description": "**Updated full version  with training, validation and test sets.**\n\nTwo newly compiled datasets for training neural networks to automatically\nidentify insect species while comparing adaptive, waveform-based frontends to\nconventional mel-spectrogram frontends for audio feature extraction. This work\nwas [published in PLOS](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011541)\nComputational Biology and the machine learning implementations were published\non [Github](https://github.com/mariusfaiss/InsectSet47-InsectSet66-Adaptive-\nRepresentations-of-Sound-for-Automatic-Insect-Recognition).\n\nThese datasets expand on the previously published\n[InsectSet32](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7072196) by including recently\npublished collections of insect recordings by citizen scientists from around\nthe world. Recordings from [BioAcoustica](https://bio.acousti.ca/), [xeno-\ncanto](http://xeno-canto.org/) and [iNaturalist](http://inaturalist.org/), as\nwell as private collections by [Baudewijn\nOde](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8929-2737) were downloaded and manually\ninspected. Files with strong noise interference or intense filtering, as well\nas files containing sounds of multiple species were removed to compile these\ndatasets. The files were standardised to 44.1 kHz mono WAV files ranging in\nlength from less than one second to several minutes. Files containing long\nperiods without insect sounds were edited into multiple smaller files with\nsilent periods no longer than 5 seconds. These files are marked as edits in\nthe annotation file and should be assigned together into train/validation/test\nsets to prevent data leakage. The annotation files contain information for\neach recording, including the file name, species name and identifier, as well\nas the data subset they were included in for training the neural network\n(training, test, validation).\n\nInsectSet47 expands on [InsectSet32](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7072196)\nwith recordings from [xeno-canto](http://xeno-canto.org/) and contains 1006\noriginal recordings from 47 species, with at least ten files per species. The\ntotal length of InsectSet47 is 22 hours. InsectSet66 further expands on\nInsectSet47 by adding research-grade audio observations from\n[iNaturalist](http://inaturalist.org/), with a total of 1554 recordings from\n66 species, a total length of over 24 hours and a minimum of ten files per\nspecies.\n\nThe datasets were split into the training, validation and test sets while\nensuring a roughly equal distribution of audio files and audio material for\nevery species in all three subsets. This resulted in a 60/20/20 split\n(train/validation/test) by file number and a 64/19.5/16.5 split by file\nlength.\n\n",
