  "description": "**Labeled songs of domestic canary M1-2016-spring (Serinus canaria)**\n\n_J. Giraudon* 123, N. Trouvain*123, A. Cazala4, C. Del Negro4, X. Hinaut123_\n\n1 Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest, France\n\n2 LaBRI, Bordeaux INP, CNRS, UMR 5800, France\n\n3 Institut des Maladies Neurogegeneratives, Universite de Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR\n5293, France\n\n4 Paris-Saclay University, UMR 9197 CNRS, Paris-Saclay Institute of\nNeuroscience, France\n\n_* these authors participated equally to this work._\n\n**General information**\n\nThis dataset contains ~3h of labeled songs (459 songs) of one male canary\n(called M1) recorded between May 24th and June 15th 2016. Songs were recorded\nin a sound-isolation chamber using a RODE M3 microphone, an external sound\ncard for microphone amplification (M-Audio Fast Track Ultra 8R), and the\nsoftware Sound Analysis Pro 2011 (SAP). SAP parameters were set with\nconservative thresholds (software threshold to 4-6) in order to record the\ninitiation of canary's songs which can be low in volume.\n\nSongs were hand labelled by one human expert using Audacity. They were then\nchecked and corrected by another human expert assisted by an automated program\nbased on recurrent neural networks (see References).\n\n**Dataset description**\n\nCanary songs are labeled using 27 different identified syllable classes + 1\n\"call\" class identifying simple off-song calls + 1 \"TRASH\" class for\nirrelevant sounds (very rare vocalizations or non-bird sounds) + 1 \"SIL\" class\nfor silence between vocalizations. Songs are annotated at the phrase level: a\nphrase consists of a repetition of a single syllable type and each phrase type\nis assigned a label.\n\nAnnotations are provided in CSV format in the\n\"M1-2016-spring_csv_annotations.zip\" archive. There is one file per song,\ncontaining:\n\n  * a \"wave\" column indicating the song's audio filename;\n  * \"start\" and \"end\" columns indicating the temporal delimitation of the label from the begining of the song, in seconds;\n  * a \"syll\" column indicating the labels.\n\nAnnotations are also provided in [Audacity TXT\nformat](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/importing_and_exporting_labels.html)\nin the \"M1-2016-spring_audacity_annotations.zip\" archive. There is one file\nper song, containing three tabulation-separated columns. The first two column\nindicates the temporal delimitation (start and end) of the phrase from the\nbegining of the song. The thrid one contains the associated label. Annotations\nfilenames match corresponding song audio filename.\n\nSongs are provided in WAV format (44kHz sampling rate) in the\n\"M1-2016-spring_audio.zip\" archive. There is one file per song: audio\nfilenames match corresponding annotation filenames.\n\n**References**\n\nThis dataset was used in:\n\nN. Trouvain, X.
