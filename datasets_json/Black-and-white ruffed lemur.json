Passive Acoustic Monitoring and Transfer Learning. BioRxiv doi:\n\nThis dataset contains approximately 60 hours of audio that contained calls of\nthe critically endangered Black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata).\nThe audio data was collected in a sub-humid rainforest site (Mangevo) in the\nsoutheast of Ranomafana National Park in Madagascar using 2 Swift recorders\n(Cornell Center for Conservation Bioacoustics). The sampling rate was set to\n48,000Hz and the recordings were collected intermittently between May 2019 and\nNovember 2020. A larger dataset exists and further recordings will be\nreleased.\n\nThe annotations files are in (.svl) format which is compatible with\nSonicVisualiser (https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/). Each audio file has a\ncorresponding .svl file. Each .svl has segments of audio that were manually\nannotated as either ''thyolo-alethe\" (presence class) or \"noise\" (absence\nclass) -- this dataset can be used to train a binary classification model.\n\nThe audio files are provided in \"Audio.zip\" and the manually verified\nannotation in \"Annotations.zip\".\n\n",
