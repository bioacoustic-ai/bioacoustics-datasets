  "description": "BirdVox-full-night: a dataset for avian flight call detection in continuous\nrecordings  \n======================================================================================  \nVersion 3.0, March 2018.\n\n  \nCreated By  \n\\----------\n\nVincent Lostanlen (1, 2, 3), Justin Salamon (2, 3), Andrew Farnsworth (1),\nSteve Kelling (1), and Juan Pablo Bello (2, 3).\n\n(1): Cornell Lab of Ornithology (CLO)  \n(2): Center for Urban Science and Progress, New York University  \n(3): Music and Audio Research Lab, New York University\n\nhttps://wp.nyu.edu/birdvox\n\n\n\nDescription  \n\\-----------\n\nThe BirdVox-full-night dataset contains 6 audio recordings, each about ten\nhours in duration. These recordings come from ROBIN autonomous recording\nunits, placed near Ithaca, NY, USA during the fall 2015. They were captured on\nthe night of September 23rd, 2015, by six different sensors, originally\nnumbered 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10.\n\nAndrew Farnsworth used the Raven software to pinpoint every avian flight call\nin time and frequency. He found 35402 flight calls in total. He estimates that\nabout 25 different species of passerines (thrushes, warblers, and sparrows)\nare present in this recording. Species are not labeled in BirdVox-full-night,\nbut it is possible to tell apart thrushes from warblers and sparrrows by\nlooking at the center frequencies of their calls. The annotation process took\n102 hours.\n\nThe dataset can be used, among other things, for the research,  \ndevelopment and testing of bioacoustic classification models, including the\nreproduction of the results reported in [1].\n\nFor details on the hardware of ROBIN recording units, we refer the reader to\n[2].\n\n[1] V.
